# Doorbellian

Doorbellian is the internal name for the "Iris" smart doorbell product. Doorbellian is focused on creating a doorbell that provides real privacy to a user. User data ***never*** touches a cloud server, so there is no way to leak your private video, or for us to sell your data. The only server interaction occurs when sending out a mobile push notification to your mobile devices, and that contains no personal data, only initiating a connection between your mobile device and the doorbell. A technical explanation will be provided when that service is implemented. <ins>[TODO](#)</ins>

This repo makes use of a [dhelper](https://github.com/nucleus-labs/dhelper.template) script quite heavily. It is a developer tool that has sped up internal development immensely. For usage help, please use `./dhelper -h` or `./dhelper --help`.
